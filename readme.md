# Geometry Dash Remake

## A Serious Project with Limitations

Welcome to the Geometry Dash Remake project. This project is a sincere attempt to recreate the beloved rhythm-based platformer game, Geometry Dash. However, it's essential to acknowledge its limitations and the circumstances under which it was created.

### A Project Without C++ Knowledge

I embarked on this journey to recreate Geometry Dash using the assistance of ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI. While ChatGPT is a powerful tool for generating code and providing guidance, it's important to note that I embarked on this project without prior knowledge of C++ programming.

### Acknowledging the Challenges

As someone new to C++ and game development, this project has been a significant learning experience. While I've put in considerable effort to understand and implement various aspects of the game, there are inherent challenges and complexities associated with developing a game of this nature.

## Known Limitations

- **Lack of C++ Proficiency**: Given my limited experience with C++, there may be code inefficiencies and unconventional practices within the project.

- **Bugs and Issues**: Like any complex software project, there are known bugs, issues, and areas that require improvement. These include issues related to collision detection, performance optimization, level customization, and UI enhancements.

## An Ongoing Journey

This project is a work in progress, and I want to emphasize that it is a sincere and serious undertaking. I am committed to learning and improving my C++ skills and addressing the project's limitations.

## Contributions

I am open to collaborations and contributions from fellow developers who have expertise in game development, C++, and Geometry Dash. If you are passionate about this project and would like to help enhance it, your contributions are welcome.

## Acknowledgments

- Geometry Dash is a registered trademark of its respective owner. This project is a remake of its own.

- ChatGPT by OpenAI has played a significant role in generating code and assisting with ideas for this project.

Please understand that this project is a serious endeavor, albeit with its current limitations. Your support and constructive input are greatly appreciated as we work together to make it better.
